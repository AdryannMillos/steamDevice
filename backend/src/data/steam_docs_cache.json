  "Valve announces three new Steam Hardware devices: Steam Machine, Steam Frame, and Steam Controller",
  "A decade after the original failure, Valve tries again. A very in-depth summary of all press coverage and official announcements.",
  "Valve has announced three new hardware products expanding the Steam Hardware family, all scheduled to launch in early 2026. The announcement introduces the Steam Controller, Steam Machine, and Steam Frame, joining the existing Steam Deck in Valve's hardware lineup.",
  "According to Valve President Gabe Newell, the expansion comes in response to continued demand from PC gamers. \"We've been super happy with the success of Steam Deck, and PC gamers have continued asking for even more ways to play all the great titles in their Steam libraries,\" Newell stated. \"Our work over the years on other hardware and even more importantly on SteamOS has enabled Steam Controller, Steam Machine, and Steam Frame to do just that.\"",
  "Why Now?",
  "If this feels familiar, a very similar announcement happened almost exactly 10 years ago! So why now? According to Valve, the timing comes down to both hardware and software maturity. The company believes they have finally worked out both aspects after years of development.",
  "The success of SteamOS on Steam Deck proved crucial, with many users already docking their devices to TVs for a console-like experience. According to Valve, 10-15% of Steam Decks are connected to an external display at any given time, and these users specifically requested more \"crispness and graphics horsepower.\" Valve saw an opportunity to provide a better experience for that use case without the weight and battery life constraints of a portable device.",
  "The original Steam Machines launched in 2015 had two critical failures: Valve didn't actually ship them themselves, and instead worked with third-party manufacturers who created a confusing multitude of different machines. Additionally, SteamOS at the time was nowhere near its current maturity. Since then, Valve has invested heavily in Proton, an open-source project for running Windows games on Linux, which has dramatically improved game compatibility on SteamOS.",
  "Jump to: Steam Machine, Steam Frame, Steam Controller.",
  "Steam Machine",
  "Steam Machine (codename Fremont) is a compact gaming PC (GabeCube) designed for big-screen gaming, with proportions very close to the GameCube. The device was specifically designed to fit under a 15cm shelf in media units, with careful attention paid to leg height, down to fractions of a millimeter. The device runs SteamOS, providing the same user experience as Steam Deck, and is designed to work with Steam Controller while supporting other accessories as well. Games that are Steam Deck Verified will automatically be verified on Steam Machine.",
  "Performance",
  "The semi-custom AMD solution features a Zen 4 CPU with peak frequencies of 4.8 GHz boost and an RDNA3 GPU running at 2.45 GHz sustained clock with 110W TDP. Valve worked with AMD on custom firmware, software and fusing to optimize performance and power. The system is designed to support 4K gaming at 60 FPS with ray tracing enabled using FSR upscaling, targeting performance comparable to current generation consoles in a compact form factor. According to Valve's design mandate, the Steam Machine needed to have enough performance to play every game on Steam at 4K 60Hz when using upscaling.",
  "When determining the performance target, Valve used the Steam Hardware Survey as a key benchmark to understand where users' home devices currently stand. According to Valve, the Steam Machine will provide equal or better performance than 70% of users currently on Steam, making it an attractive upgrade path for those on older machines. In terms of GPU equivalency, the RDNA3 configuration is comparable to an AMD Radeon 7600M XT laptop GPU or an Nvidia RTX 4060 on the desktop side. Valve has demonstrated the system running demanding AAA titles including Cyberpunk 2077, Black Myth: Wukong, Hades II, and Silent Hill f.",
  "Cooling & Thermal Design",
  "Valve took an unusual approach by designing the fan first, recognizing that heat removal requirements dictate necessary airflow. The result is a 120mm axial fan running at 500-2,000 RPM with just 0.5-1mm blade-to-frame clearance. At idle and light tasks, the system runs in the mid-20s dB, reaching only 28-30 dB at full load.",
  "The cooling system features four approximately 8mm heat pipes and an aluminum fin stack that contacts the CPU with phase change thermal interface material and the GPU with paste. The fin stack doubles as RF shielding between the motherboard and antennas. The system maintains 95% flow performance versus unrestricted bottom intake even with the current leg height, and includes a plastic ridge on the bottom to block hot exhaust recirculation.",
  "Living rooms present challenging thermal environments where devices can be placed in corners or behind objects, so the system features 360-degree intake to ensure adequate cooling regardless of placement. Valve invested extensive computational fluid dynamics analysis into the design.",
  "The 120mm cooling fan is a Delta unit slightly thicker than the standard 25mm for extra static pressure, and it includes integrated antenna mounts and IO mounts. The 300W internal power supply is integrated to the point where it's actually part of the chassis, with the cooling system pulling air directly through it, eliminating any need for the power supply to have its own fan.",
  "Custom Motherboard & Power",
  "The motherboard is a custom 10-layer PCB required for GDDR6 routing, using back drilling techniques to remove via stubs that could cause signal reflections. All I/O is routed through the CPU without a separate AMD chipset. The custom board enables HDMI CEC support, allowing the system to automatically turn on TVs and soundbars, configure inputs, and wake with a single button press. Valve tested this functionality against a wide variety of home entertainment equipment. This functionality specifically required Valve to build a custom motherboard, which means it wouldn't work on DIY builds without serious cooperation between hardware makers.",
  "The 300W internal power supply uses blade connectors directly to the motherboard (not cables) and achieves over 92% efficiency in most scenarios. The custom Chicony power supply also serves as RF shielding. Total system power runs approximately 200W+ under typical load. The VRM includes 6 phases for GPU core, 2-3 phases for memory, and approximately 4 phases total for CPU split between different rails (VSoC, Vcore, etc.).",
  "Connectivity",
  "The system features four dedicated antennas: two for Wi-Fi 6E (2x2 configuration), one for Bluetooth, and one dedicated 2.4GHz radio for Steam Controller. The Wi-Fi antennas are oriented orthogonally to each other for polarity diversification, providing robust signal reception. The antennas are mounted to the heatsink for optimal positioning and intentionally separated by metal to minimize spectrum interference. This separation (versus the Deck's combined unit) ensures better reliability with no contention between devices.",
  "The Steam Machine's HDMI port is officially listed as HDMI 2.0, but the underlying hardware is actually HDMI 2.1 capable. Valve engineers have confirmed that select HDMI 2.1 features including HDR, AMD FreeSync, and VRR (Variable Refresh Rate) are active and functional, with the port tested at HDMI 2.1 speeds supporting 4K @ 120Hz. The limitation to the HDMI 2.0 designation is not a hardware constraint but a legal one: in February 2024, the HDMI Forum rejected AMD's proposal for open-source HDMI 2.1 driver implementation, making it impossible to officially support the full HDMI 2.1 specification in SteamOS's open-source Linux drivers without violating HDMI Forum licensing requirements. Users seeking full unrestricted display capabilities should use the DisplayPort 1.4 output, which supports up to 4K @ 240Hz or 8K @ 60Hz with no such limitations.",
  "Upgradeability & Repairability",
  "The system has a directly exposed SSD for easy replacement. It ships with M.2 2230 drives but supports full-size M.2 2280 drives. Valve chose the smaller drive purely for logistical reasons rather than paying a premium for the compact size. The microSD slot uses UHS-I standard, the same as Steam Deck, with no benefit from microSD Express.",
  "The DDR5 RAM uses laptop style SO-DIMM modules and is upgradable, but not very easily. The CPU and GPU are BGA soldered and not upgradeable due to thermal and size constraints, though a laptop-style BIOS is available with some frequency tuning options, albeit not as extensive as desktop motherboard BIOS. Valve has confirmed they're hoping to continue their Steam Deck partnership with iFixit to make replacement parts available for end users.",
  "Customization",
  "Customization options include a magnetic front panel where users can 3D print custom designs. Valve will release CAD files for the community. Examples shown include plain black, cherry red wood, Team Fortress 2 themed, and even an e-ink display showing temps and fan speed (an internal test project revealing the codename \"Fremont,\" not for sale but users could DIY). The customizable RGB light bar shows download progress, system status, and custom animations.",
  "Software Features",
  "Software features include fast suspend/resume within seconds, the ability to pause games and resume days or weeks later, and multiple game suspend capability (though one at a time is recommended). Background updates for OS, games, and cloud saves occur while the device is off, ensuring games are always ready to play. The LED bar shows progress even with the TV off.",
  "Valve has recently implemented a new zstd compression scheme for game downloads on Steam that requires significantly less CPU for decompression, reducing the computational overhead during game installation and updates. This improvement, combined with SteamOS optimizations for VRAM management and suspend/resume with discrete graphics (moving data between system RAM and VRAM, which wasn't needed on Steam Deck's unified memory APU), makes the Steam Machine capable of efficient background processing while maintaining low idle power consumption.",
  "Valve will provide Steamworks APIs that allow game developers to detect which platform they're running on, enabling games to automatically select optimal default settings for Steam Machine (similar to how many games already auto-detect Steam Deck settings). Desktop mode is fully capable, able to run Blender, browsers, and terminal applications, potentially serving as a primary PC for less demanding users. The system can also install Windows with the same support level as Steam Deck.",
  "For those planning to use Steam Machine as an all-in-one living room entertainment device, it's worth noting that Valve has no plans to offer bespoke media-streaming app downloads via the default SteamOS interface. Users will need to rely on streaming services functioning through Linux web browsers, and some services' DRM implementations may block access to Linux-based browsers by default.",
  "Pricing & DIY Options",
  "Valve positions the pricing as comparable to a similarly specced PC in the entry-level space, competitive with parts-based builds rather than console pricing. Unlike traditional consoles, Valve won't subsidize the hardware with game sales. This decision serves two purposes: it avoids competing with potential partners who might sell Steam games and software, and it acknowledges that the Steam Machine is a full-fledged PC capable of being used beyond gaming. While Valve is willing to work with select companies like Lenovo to bring future Steam Machines to market, partners are likely waiting to see how Valve's own machine performs first.",
  "For those interested in building their own Steam Machine, Valve won't be releasing a formal standalone SteamOS for custom hardware configurations anytime soon. However, Valve has expanded the list of supported third-party devices and has supported installing the Steam Deck recovery image on AMD CPU and GPU systems for some time, recently updating it to support their latest Zen 5 and RDNA4 architecture processors. Valve continues to actively improve hardware support, just recently they fixed booting issues on the latest AMD CPU platforms and added support for Intel Lunar Lake processors.",
  "Nothing prevents users from building their own Steam Machine and installing the software for free, though they will miss out on features like HDMI CEC control. The bulk of the experience should work pretty much out of the box, and a release supporting a broader range of hardware may come in the future, though this depends on better support for Intel and especially Nvidia GPUs.",
  "Hardware Specifications",
  "Steam Frame",
  "Steam Frame (codename Deckard) is a wireless VR headset powered by a Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor, running SteamOS. The device has been in development since at least 2019, predating the Steam Deck launch and the pandemic VR boom. Some engineers have been working on the project for approximately six years, starting immediately after the Valve Index. Inspired by both the Valve Index and Steam Deck, the device supports both VR and non-VR games from users' Steam libraries with standalone play capability.",
  "Hardware Design",
  "The headset features a modular design with a 185g core unit (compute, displays, and optics) that detaches via three toolless clips from the battery pack and headstrap. The multi-cell segmented battery provides a contoured back-of-head fit with 21.6Wh capacity. The core module can be separated from the headstrap for other headstrap solutions, enabling future third-party accessories. Valve chose the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 over typical XR chips, prioritizing gaming performance with higher CPU frequencies (up to 3.3 GHz) and GPU clock speeds (900 MHz Adreno 750) better suited for FEX emulation and Proton translation layers.",
  "One of the most significant engineering challenges was optimizing memory bandwidth with cameras, displays, wireless streaming, CPU, and GPU all competing for access to the unified 16GB LPDDR5X memory simultaneously. According to Valve's engineers, managing this data flow complexity across all these subsystems was among the most complicated aspects of the entire device. The compact head-mounted form factor also required premium power delivery components to achieve the necessary power density in such limited space.",
  "Display & Optics",
  "The headset's displays use custom pancake lenses designed in-house with a generous eyebox and sharp edge-to-edge clarity. Valve chose LCD panels over OLED due to advantages in field of view, eyebox, cost, persistence, and weight. The displays feature modest canting similar to the Index for expanded horizontal FOV with nearly full binocular overlap, and the panels have truncated corners for nose clearance. Display brightness targets slightly above 100 nits at the eye, with an 8% duty cycle at all refresh rates. The headset supports super sampling at least 3,000 pixels wide in SteamVR settings.",
  "Comfort & Ergonomics",
  "Physical comfort features include a removable magnetic face gasket with spacer options for glasses and long eyelashes, a removable nose gasket that allows some air and light leak to reduce claustrophobia, and a physical IPD adjustment dial on top of the headset. The strap system uses soft ski goggle-style straps with an optional ergonomic top strap included in the accessory kit. Once adjusted, the straps don't need readjustment like ski goggles. Prescription lens inserts are planned, with Valve applying lessons learned from Index development challenges.",
  "Tracking & Foveated Streaming",
  "The tracking system delivers 200-250 controller updates per second, matching the Valve Index's performance. Eye tracking operates at 8-12ms update rates, meeting Valve's goals for stream quality. The headset features 18 IR LEDs per controller positioned strategically for full coverage, and can track in complete darkness using IR illumination.",
  "A key technology is foveated streaming, which only sends full high-quality content to where the user is looking. When the viewed area represents about one-tenth of the total pixel area, this effectively provides a 10x multiplier in bandwidth efficiency. This enables a 250 Mbps target bandwidth over Wi-Fi 7, with encoding latency of just 1-2ms on modern GPUs (4-5ms on older VR-capable GPUs) and total end-to-end latency of 10-20ms in good conditions. The foveated streaming window represents only about 10% of the total video stream.",
  "Controllers",
  "The controllers feature capacitive sensing on ABXY, D-pad, thumb rests, grips, and finger sensing capabilities. They have two-stage actuating triggers and grips, independent gyros in each controller that can be rebound for aiming, and can function as laser pointer mice with the grip button. Optional Index-style knuckles hand straps are available in the accessory kit. The controllers achieve 40-hour battery life per AA battery and are compatible with five-finger tracking like Index Knuckles controllers.",
  "Wireless Adapter",
  "The Steam Frame includes a 6GHz Wi-Fi 6E wireless adapter in the box, providing a dedicated point-to-point connection between the headset and PC for streaming. The adapter plugs into a PC via USB and establishes a direct connection to the headset's dedicated 6GHz radio, completely separate from general internet traffic. This approach gives Valve firmware-level control over the entire network stack and eliminates common wireless VR bottlenecks like router congestion, distance limitations, ISP-supplied equipment limitations, or interference from other devices.",
  "The headset's dual radio architecture is key to the streaming experience: one radio operates on 6GHz exclusively for VR streaming, while a second radio connects to home Wi-Fi on 5GHz or 2.4GHz for general internet connectivity. This dual-radio setup means there's no bandwidth competition between game streaming and other network activities, and it eliminates the extra network hop through a router that traditional wireless streaming requires.",
  "The headset can maintain quality streaming up to 15 meters away from the adapter with direct line of sight, and multiple headsets can operate concurrently in the same space.",
  "While enthusiasts with premium Wi-Fi 7 routers can technically bypass the included adapter and stream directly through their own equipment, Valve expects most users will prefer the included adapter for its plug-and-play simplicity and optimized performance. Steam Frame does not support DisplayPort or HDMI input, it is exclusively a wireless streaming and standalone device, with no tethered mode available.",
  "Audio",
  "The audio system features four 16mm drivers total (two per ear) with opposing driver orientation to cancel vibrations that could interfere with IMU tracking. The speakers project front-to-back, different from the Index's arm approach, resulting in more sound bleed than the Index as the speakers don't fire directly into the ears. The headset supports Bluetooth headphones and 3.5mm adapters. A dual microphone array on the bottom handles voice pickup, with Valve aiming to match the Index's reputation for microphone quality.",
  "Thermal Management",
  "The device runs approximately 7W when streaming and 20W+ when running games locally. Thermal management includes two heat pipes flanking the silicon with the PCB cleared for rear contact, a fin stack at the top near the brow line with ventilation pointed away from the user, and a single custom blower fan in the core module center governed by thermostats across the PCB plus chip sensors. The displays benefit from warmth, which actually helps LCD transition times at high refresh rates.",
  "Valve faced a unique thermal design challenge with dual temperature thresholds: the SoC's maximum operating temperature and the user's comfort threshold for heat on their face. Significant engineering effort went into thermally decoupling the hot components from where the headset contacts the user's skin, ensuring comfort during extended play sessions.",
  "The headset features approximately 10 external thermistors plus around 30 internal die temperature sensors throughout the device, providing a comprehensive thermal map. Custom fan curve algorithms read all sensor data and adjust fan speed based on workload type, with the fan running quietly during normal operation but capable of ramping up significantly for power users who want maximum performance.",
  "Software & Compatibility",
  "Software compatibility has been a major focus. Valve has been actively contributing to the FEX emulation layer for the past 1.5-2 years, enabling x86 Windows games to run on ARM processors through a combination of translation and emulation. Initially, most games didn't work, but about a year ago most games began functioning properly. The headset can run demanding titles smoothly in standalone mode, with 16GB of unified RAM enabling an extended portion of the Steam catalog to be played without streaming. Despite these standalone capabilities, Valve describes Steam Frame as a \"streaming-first\" device, with PC streaming expected to deliver the best experience for more demanding VR titles.",
  "As an example of this streaming-first approach, Valve's flagship VR title Half-Life: Alyx was only demonstrated via PC streaming at the press event. While Valve is exploring the possibility of standalone performance, they are not yet making any commitments about getting the game running natively on the headset's hardware. Notably, Valve has confirmed it is not currently developing new VR games for Steam Frame, a stark contrast to the Valve Index launch, where Half-Life: Alyx arrived less than a year after the headset. Steam Frame will instead rely on existing Steam VR titles and third-party content.",
  "The device offers four play modes: Local VR, Streaming VR, Local flat-screen (virtual cinema), and Streaming flat-screen. The virtual display supports configurable resolution and refresh rates for flat-screen gaming. Users can sideload Android APKs directly just like non-Steam applications on Steam Deck, with Valve expecting VR APKs that don't leverage proprietary APIs to work without issues. Desktop mode is available where users can launch windows at various sizes. According to Eurogamer, the core can even connect to a display via USB-C to function as a compact gaming PC.",
  "Pricing & Availability",
  "Valve confirmed the Index is no longer in production but will be supported indefinitely, and is open to conversations with other companies to manufacture Index accessories and components. The Steam Frame is positioned as a premium VR headset with Valve aiming for a price less than the Index, with consumer launch planned for early 2026.",
  "Hardware Specifications",
  "The expansion port under the nose bridge features 8 lanes @ 2.5Gbps MIPI camera interface / PCIe Gen 4 (1-lane), potentially supporting a color passthrough camera as a future addon.",
  "Steam Controller",
  "Steam Controller (codename Triton) features the same input capabilities as Steam Deck, designed to play all Steam games across multiple platforms. The original Steam Controller, discontinued in 2019 and liquidated for $5, focused on mouse and keyboard PC games but lacked functionality for traditional controller games. Despite this, it maintained a passionate fanbase for its unique capabilities.",
  "Input Technology",
  "The controller introduces next-generation TMR (Tunnel Magnetoresistance) magnetic thumbsticks, representing an evolution beyond Hall Effect technology with the same sensing fidelity but lower power consumption and minimal deadzone. The sticks are soldered rather than removable, reflecting Valve's confidence in their long-term reliability. They feature capacitive touch surfaces and a grippy texture similar to the Steam Deck OLED.",
  "The trackpads are squared like the Deck but slightly bigger and canted (rotated inwards) for more natural ergonomics in the controller form factor. They feature pressure sensitivity for configurable click strength and refined haptic feedback using motors similar to the Deck OLED. The D-pad has been reworked to stay centered more reliably with crisper diagonal presses compared to the base Steam Deck.",
  "Haptics & Ergonomics",
  "The controller features four grip buttons on the back that are naturally placed and easier to press than the Steam Deck's raised design. The haptic system includes four motors total: two LRA motors in the trackpads for HD tactile feedback, and two high-output LRA motors in the grips for HD game haptics including rumble. These linear motors have wider bandwidth performance, functioning like high-fidelity speakers in the haptics world, capable of replicating complex waveforms better than previous generations.",
  "GripSense & Gyro",
  "The controller includes GripSense capacitive sensors throughout, particularly in the right grip. The sensing is per-hand (not per-finger), providing continuous gradient feedback about grip proximity and pressure rather than individual finger tracking. This enables activating or deactivating the gyro simply by holding the controller normally, and can trigger other assignable effects beyond gyro. Users can configure the gyro to disable by loosening their grip to recenter, then reactivate by gripping again.",
  "Sensors are present on thumbsticks, trackpads, grips, and face buttons, covering all input surfaces. The 6-axis IMU provides gyro pointer functionality that allows the controller to function as a mouse cursor by pointing at the screen, with low-latency motion tracking and no external sensors required. The gyro can be activated via grip sense, thumb position, or button assignment.",
  "The controller's antenna uses a grounded design for ESD (electrostatic discharge) protection, a lesson learned from the Index. Positioned between the sticks in an ideal spot away from hands regardless of grip style, the design solves cost, functionality, and ESD protection simultaneously. The controller is user serviceable with a screwdriver, allowing access to the battery and components, though no official parts program has been announced.",
  "Design Philosophy & Features",
  "The controller is designed with simple plastics rather than rubberized grip textures, keeping costs down while maintaining high-quality inputs. It's notably lighter than traditional controllers, though it's not positioned as an \"Elite\" or \"Pro\" controller. Triggers aren't adjustable or adaptive, and buttons lack mouse-click clickiness. However, the trackpad can function as a mouse with left/right click, grip buttons can summon a laser pointer in VR, and users can leverage community controller profiles for keyboard-centric PC games.",
  "The controller's versatile input methods enable creative control schemes. For example, in Balatro, players can use the game's built-in controller compatibility, or configure the trackpads with the right for movement and left split for left/right click, or even use gyro mouse with face buttons for clicks. This flexibility showcases the controller's ability to adapt to different game types and player preferences.",
  "When used with Steam Frame, the controller includes IR LEDs for VR tracking, positioned beside the power LED to help users find the controller in VR. The Steam Machine has Puck functionality built-in, which means the included Puck is essentially extra and can be used on another PC or kept near the couch for convenient charging. All buttons feature capacitive sensing, including ABXY, D-pad, thumb rests, and grips. The two-stage actuating triggers provide precise analog input.",
  "Steam Controller Puck",
  "The Steam Controller Puck serves as both a wireless adapter and magnetic charging dock. The magnetic attachment provides quick snap-on/off, connecting only in the correct orientation thanks to magnetic shunts. Using the same wireless technology as the original Steam Controller, the Puck provides a proprietary 2.4GHz wireless connection with best-in-class 8ms effective latency and 250Hz polling rate (4ms polling interval) measured at 5 meters minimum range.",
  "Crucially, unlike Bluetooth where latency doubles with each additional controller, the 8ms latency remains consistent even with up to 4 Steam Controllers per Puck. For larger multiplayer scenarios, Valve has tested up to 4 Pucks on a single system for a maximum of 16 players. This connection is more stable than Bluetooth. While a device with good Bluetooth can perform well, consistency varies greatly with environment, and when multiple Bluetooth devices share bandwidth, it can cause lag and dropout.",
  "The controller also supports wired USB play with similar latency, though Bluetooth is slightly worse. The rechargeable Li-ion battery delivers 35+ hours of play time conservatively and can be charged via the Puck or USB.",
  "The Puck supports re-pairing to different devices, enabling seamless switching between systems. For example, users who purchase the Steam Machine + Steam Controller bundle will have both a standalone Puck and the integrated receiver in the Steam Machine. The controller can store pairing information for both, allowing users to switch between their Steam Machine and desktop PC without entering any UI or reprogramming. Valve is also adapting Aperture Hand Lab to work as a tutorial for the Steam Controller, similar to the tutorial available for Steam Deck: Aperture Desk Job.",
  "Hardware Specifications",
  "Ecosystem Integration",
  "All three devices are designed to work together as an integrated ecosystem. MicroSD cards are hot-swappable between Steam Deck, Steam Machine, and Steam Frame, allowing instant library transfers by simply moving the card between devices. The Steam Machine can stream games to Steam Frame, Steam Deck, phones, tablets, and laptops.",
  "While the Steam Machine has the Steam Controller Puck functionality built-in, the Steam Frame wireless adapter is NOT integrated into the Steam Machine. To stream VR games from Steam Machine to Steam Frame, users need to plug the included Steam Frame wireless adapter into one of the front USB-C ports, which is specifically positioned for this purpose.",
  "Although the Steam Machine includes a capable Wi-Fi 6E radio, Valve recommends using the dedicated adapter because streaming VR while maintaining internet connectivity requires two separate Wi-Fi radios — one for the 6GHz VR streaming connection and another for general network access.",
  "According to Valve, the collaboration between their hardware and software engineering teams on Steam Machine makes SteamOS better for everyone. Third-party gaming PCs and handheld devices that run SteamOS benefit from improvements developed for Valve's own hardware. This creates a virtuous cycle where Valve's hardware development drives platform improvements that enhance the entire SteamOS ecosystem, making it more viable for other manufacturers and DIY builders.",
  "Steam's platform features over 100,000 titles from practically every publisher, with 30 million active players at any given moment. Former console exclusives like Halo, God of War, and Spider-Man are now available on Steam. Valve is expanding the Verified program with Steam Machine Verified, allowing customers to understand how their games will run on the device. Games that are Steam Deck Verified will automatically receive Steam Machine Verified status. A Frame Verified program is also coming to verify both flat-screen and local VR standalone content on the Steam Frame.",
  "What About Steam Deck 2?",
  "Don't expect a Steam Deck 2 anytime soon. While Valve was clear this announcement wasn't about the future of Steam Deck, they addressed the topic when asked by press. According to Valve, they're interested to work on what's next for Steam Deck, but are waiting for a truly worthwhile performance upgrade rather than rushing to market with incremental improvements.",
  "Valve stated they are not interested in releasing a Steam Deck 2 with only 20%, 30%, or even 50% more performance at the same battery life. They want something more substantial - a genuine generational leap. The company has been researching silicon advancements and architectural improvements, and believes they have a pretty good idea of what the next version of Steam Deck is going to be.",
  "The problem? No current SOC offerings in the market meet Valve's criteria for what they consider \"truly next-gen performance\" for a Steam Deck successor. Until the silicon landscape evolves to enable that significant performance jump while maintaining the portable form factor and battery life expectations, Valve appears content to let the current Steam Deck (and its OLED variant) continue serving the handheld gaming market.",
  "Availability",
  "All three products will be available in regions where Steam Deck currently ships (United States, Canada, United Kingdom, European Union, and Australia), as well as in Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, and Taiwan through KOMODO.",
  "Valve plans to begin shipping in early 2026, with specific launch dates and pricing to be announced after the new year. The products are currently available for wishlisting on Steam's official hardware pages.",
  "Conclusion",
  "Ten years ago, Valve's living room ambitions stumbled on immature software and fragmented hardware partnerships. This time, they're doing it themselves, and the software is finally ready. SteamOS has matured through the Steam Deck's success, Proton has unlocked the Windows gaming catalog on Linux, and FEX emulation is making ARM-based VR viable.",
  "Valve has clearly learned from 2015. The real question is whether the PC gaming market is ready to embrace a console-like experience when building your own rig has been the default for decades. Steam Machine targets the living room, Steam Frame bets on standalone VR's future, and the new Steam Controller bridges both worlds with the flexibility PC gamers expect.",
  "Valve's ecosystem play is ambitious: hot-swappable microSD cards between devices, native VR streaming between Steam Machine and Steam Frame, and improvements that benefit the entire SteamOS community. If the pricing lands right and the software delivers on its promises, early 2026 could mark the moment PC gaming finally cracks the living room. For real this time.",
